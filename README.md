# DataScienceCapstone
Final project in the Coursera Data Science course

The aim of the Data Science Capstone project was to explore natural language processing (NLP) and create a Shiny application that predicts the next word based on a word or phrase of input from a user.

This repository consists of the server and user interface code for a Shiny Application that predicts the next word based on text collocations using the quanteda package.
